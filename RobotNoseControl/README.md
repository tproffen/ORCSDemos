## Robot New Control

In this demo students can use their nose to control a robot. The machine learning part is using the <a href="https://dancingwithai.media.mit.edu/">Dancing with AI</a> Scratch extensions to track the player nose a,d send commands to a <a href="https://microbit.org/">Microbit</a> controlled robot via Bluetooth.

### Setup

- Copy <a href="https://tproffen.github.io/prg-extension-boilerplate/static/HexFiles/microbit-MaqueenControllerV2.hex">this program</a> to the MicroBit. This will work with the <a href="https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1783.html">McQueen robot</a>. But it can be easily modified for other MicroBi powered robots. 

- Use <a href="https://tproffen.github.io/prg-extension-boilerplate/">this version</a> of Scrach to open and run the code.

You can also open the demo directly using this <a href="https://tproffen.github.io/prg-extension-boilerplate/create/?project=">link</a>.
